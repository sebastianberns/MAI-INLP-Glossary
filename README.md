## Linguistic terms

    polyseme     word or phrase with different, but related senses

    polysemy     capacity for a word to have multiple meanings

    stop words   words w/o meaning (articles, propositions, punctuation, …) [the, is, at, which, on, …]

    morphemes    subunits in morphology (e.g. un-believe-able-ly)

    stem         type of morpheme (main, meaning)

    affix        type of morpheme (additional

    prefix       morpheme preciding the stem (e.g. un-certain, un-chain)

    sufix        morpheme following the stem (e.g. eat-s)

    circumfix    prefix and sufix (e.g. sagen: ge-sag-t)

    infix        affix inserted in the middle (e.g. abso-fucking-lutely)

    compounding  combination of stems (e.g. doghouse)
